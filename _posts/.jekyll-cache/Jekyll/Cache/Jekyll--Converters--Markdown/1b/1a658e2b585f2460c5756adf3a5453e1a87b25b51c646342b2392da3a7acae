<p>Join us as we expose the steps that make Confidential Containers (CoCo) easy to provision and run your first workload! CoCo is an open source community working to enable cloud native confidential computing by leveraging trusted execution environments (TEE) to protect containers and data. CoCo integrates multiple features from many open source projects that need to need to securely and efficiently work together on many distinct hardware technologies, supporting several CRI runtimes, and more that can appear to be complex to get started.
