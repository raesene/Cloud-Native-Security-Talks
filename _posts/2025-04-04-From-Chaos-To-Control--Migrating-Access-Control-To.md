## Abstract

Designing access control that works seamlessly for individuals and scales to millions of resources is a complex challenge.  From lackluster search performance to feature inconsistency and multi-tenant schema discrepancies, there’s no shortage of issues to face.  Join the Grafana Access squad’s journey through the ups and downs of how we’re tackling these issues using OpenFGA, a CNCF sandbox project, by porting our existing access control schema and rethinking our resource search strategy.  If you’ve ever wondered what it takes as a platform engineer to support access control on a multi-tenant system with millions of resources, this is your opportunity to learn how to orchestrate a migration from your current access control system and hear about the peculiar challenges of developing security critical systems.
