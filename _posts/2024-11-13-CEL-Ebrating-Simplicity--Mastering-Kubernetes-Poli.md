## Abstract

As Kubernetes deployments grow increasingly complex, robust policy enforcement is crucial. The Common Expression Language (CEL) provides a powerful solution, enabling the creation of sophisticated, human-readable expressions for Kubernetes policies. This session explores CEL's integration with Kubernetes, simplifying policy definition and enforcement. Key takeaways: - Fundamentals of CEL and its Kubernetes integration. - Practical use cases for CEL in admission control, resource management, and security. - Enhancing policy expressiveness and flexibility with CEL. - Introduction to CEL Playground for testing and validating CEL expressions. Through live demos, learn to leverage CEL and CEL Playground for streamlined policy management in Kubernetes. Ideal for administrators, developers, and DevOps professionals, this session equips you to enhance your Kubernetes policies using CEL. Join us to discover how CEL and CEL Playground can transform your Kubernetes policy management.
