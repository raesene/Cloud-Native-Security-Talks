## Abstract

Nowadays mature container platforms (such as Docker, Kubernetes and LXD) provide users a way to extract files from a running container. There are several different design approaches for implementing such a copy feature. In this talk, Yuval and Ariel will present the ups and downs of the different implementations with a focus on security and possible vulnerabilities.Throughout the presentation, different vulnerabilities that affected the major container engines will be reviewed. A live proof of concept of a vulnerability in the Docker copy command will be presented.
