An admission controller allows you to intercept or mutate request to the Kubernetes API before it's persisted as an object in Kubernetes . By utilizing admission controllers to intercept objects we have to the flexibility to enforce enterprise security policies for developers and operators of Kubernetes.   In this demo heavy session, we will review admission controller capabilities and use cases for extending Kubernetes security. We will also demonstrate how to use an admission controller to restrict access to specific service types in a Kubernetes cluster.
