## Abstract

In the CNCF landscape we have plenty of ebpf based security solutions that help us protect our k8s cluster from runtime vulnerabilities. On paper though Falco, Tetragon and KubeArmor look very similar. Eventually you have to make a choice on which one best fits your needs. To give you additional insights to make your decision join this session. We have run extensive benchmarks against those three solutions and will answer the following questions that came out of our testing: - What are the different featuresets? - What about the performance impact of each agent? - Which privileges does each solution need? - What are the pros and cons across the three options?
