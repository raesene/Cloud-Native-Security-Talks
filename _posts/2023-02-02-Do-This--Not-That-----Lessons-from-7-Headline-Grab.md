## Abstract

What leads to a cloud security breach? Misconfigurations, exposed APIs, cryptojacking, and more. Attacker motivations haven’t changed much, but their methods have adapted to new technologies. As a defender, you must adapt too. In this talk, we walk through 7 examples of real cloud breaches, discuss what went wrong, why it was interesting, and what you can do to avoid ending up on such a list. Learn about the differences between cloud vs on-premise threats and breaches. What has changed? Are certain attack methods more prevalent, attractive, or easy to execute in the cloud? Why? What are the high-level cloud attack trends (and defenses) and how to cope? Each of the 7 breaches we discuss involve cloud infrastructure. We will highlight a particular attack pattern, response pattern, or other interesting element that can give insight into how to better protect ourselves in cloud environments. You won’t hear general, “lock your stuff down” guidance; each scenario will have a specific takeaway so you avoid a similar pitfall.
