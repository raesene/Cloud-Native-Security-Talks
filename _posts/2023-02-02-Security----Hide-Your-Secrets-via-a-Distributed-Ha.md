## Abstract

Cloud hardware security module (HSM) provides cloud-based services to host encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations inside HSM. It can improve the security level of your services. However, it also brings performance challenges for users since cryptographic operations are handled remotely in HSM. Distributed HSM is a solution that satisfies both security and performance requirements. It provides both remote and local HSMs for users and can be hosted on Cloud, on-premise and on edge. Cryptographic operations can even be performed in the same node with the service. In this talk we walk you through how distributed HSM works and showcase some typical user cases.
