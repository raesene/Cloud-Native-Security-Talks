title: "Exit Stage Left: Replacing Theater with Chaos - Kelly Shortridge, Capsule8"
categories: ["Cloud Native Security Day North America 2020"]

## Abstract

Kelly will explore how security theater leads to increased organizational friction, especially in the realm of software delivery, rather than promoting safety. She'll contrast these dramatics with a security chaos engineering approach â€“ one which embraces the importance of convenience, alignment with organizational goals, and the wisdom derived from failure.
