title: "Kubernetes Runtime Security: What Happens if a Container Goes Bad? - Jen Tong & Maya Kaczorowski, Google (Intermediate Skill Level) (Slides Attached)"
categories: ["KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018"]

## Abstract

Kubernetes security typically focuses on infrastructure: verifying that configuration is safe, and your deployment has no known issues. In this talk Jen and Maya will focus on a different aspect: runtime security. Runtime security is about mitigating damage done when part of your deployment is compromised.  They'll start with an overview of common runtime security concerns, and discuss how they change as you move to containers and Kubernetes. Next, theyâ€™ll highlight existing features that help you respond to these risks, and explore popular tools to detect and control compromises. They'll finish off with a demo that shows these techniques in action as they protect a web application.  You'll leave with an understanding of how to plan ahead to minimize impact, and how to respond to events when they happen.
