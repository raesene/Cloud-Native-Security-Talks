## Abstract

Containers in Kubernetes share a common Linux kernel so how can we limit access where it isn’t required so we can follow the principle of least privilege? Join Natalia and Duffie as they each explore different approaches to harden your container security with Secure Computing (seccomp) and eBPF! The talk will begin with an overview and comparison between seccomp and eBPF and how they both can solve the same problem - limiting access to the Linux Kernel that all containers share. This will be a fun talk, showing each solution with a live demo. You will leave this talk with a better understanding of how to limit what system calls a process can make and restrict your containers’ behavior to only access the files, binaries and external DNS names they need and nothing more. Which is the right solution for your environment? Come and learn about two of the commonly used technologies in use today!
