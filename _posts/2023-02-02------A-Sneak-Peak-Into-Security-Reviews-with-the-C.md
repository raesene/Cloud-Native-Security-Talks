## Abstract

In this talk, we explore the need for open source security reviews, how they are different from audits, and how they are used. We will share the TAG contributions with respect to the upcoming Security guide and provide a sneak peek into its contents. Finally, we also start the dialog on to get onboard and involve in the development of this guide
