Melissa and Sarah will go over the challenges they are facing and how they are overcoming some when working with compliance auditors. Sarah will share how Collins is looking to move cybersecurity authorizations from a risk management focus to an active cyber defense focus. Melissa will share how she has integrated auto-document generation for compliance reviews and a vision to transition to virtual dashboards.
