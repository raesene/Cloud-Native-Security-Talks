Okay, wait, let us surprise you even more; what if you get all the above and a way to administer their control in the K8s cluster! Yes, you heard it right, Unveiling to you the intersection of Kyverno and DockerSlim! This panel by Shuting, Ruhika, and Mritunjay will demonstrate how these two projects are making the lifecycle of the software supply chain more secure. Kyverno's policies leveraged with DockerSlim's combo of minified image and the auto-generated Seccomp profile will make your cluster security management just another YAML chore without you being a Linux syscalls expert!
