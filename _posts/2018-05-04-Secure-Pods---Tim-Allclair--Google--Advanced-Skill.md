## Abstract

What is a "secure pod"? What does it mean for a Kubernetes workload to have strong isolation? With the announcement of Kata Containers and the overflowing multitenancy deep-dive at the last Kubecon, it's clear that these topics are building momentum.  This talk will cover the current state of container isolation and why there is a need for technologies like hypervisor-based containers in order to provide stronger security boundaries. It will also include a discussion of how these technologies fit into Kubernetes and a roadmap for secure pods.  This is a rapidly evolving area, and Tim anticipates that a proposal for secure pods will be finalized by May. This talk will be shaped by the status or outcome of that proposal.
