## Abstract

Due to upcoming regulations, the increased time organizations need to meet compliance requirements is slowing down their ability to innovate rapidly. Businesses are transitioning from periodic compliance assessments to continuous compliance monitoring, which offers constant, real-time visibility into an enterprise's ability to meet regulatory guidelines. With the rapid evolution of regulatory requirements and the surge in recent data breaches, it is evident that customers need a continuously updated and comprehensive understanding of their compliance status and risk exposure. In this session, attendees will learn how adopting a code-based approach to compliance—powered by agentic AI—can accelerate their go-to-market strategy by automating the creation of compliance artifacts. Catalog, controls, and automatic assessments will be discussed. As a use case, the new DORA regulations will be discussed along with the workflow this technology can enable to help organizations adhere to DORA.
