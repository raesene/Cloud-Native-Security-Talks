title: "Technical View: Comparison of Container Orchestration and Management Systems - Lei Zhang, HyperHQ"
categories: ["CloudNativeCon + KubeCon 2016"]

## Abstract

The large-scale cluster orchestration management has been evolved to a new age which is represented by open source projects like Kubernetes working with containers like Docker. This presentation will provide a detailed comparison between the design and implementation of Kubernetes, Swarmkit, Mesos, and legacy Swarm+Compose from a technical view. We will also explain the pros & cons of each system, the scenarios where users might want to use one or combination of these systems. What's more, the last part of this presentation will talk about the design of Borg and how it deeply influenced the idea of Kubernetes and other projects. We hope audiences can learn the way we figure out these differences besides the comparison result.
