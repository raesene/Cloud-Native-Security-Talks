## Abstract

As the cloud native ecosystem matures, the focus shifts more towards security. One of the key challenges in this area for enterprises is ensuring that you trust the code that's running in your production environment and that it hasn't been tampered with by malicious third parties.   In this session, you'll learn about how Notary addresses this problem, how to get started with Notary and your image registry, and how you can use Kubernetes admission controllers to verify your images against Notary.
