## Abstract

OPA, Cedar, OpenFGA, Topaz, OPAL, OSO, should I continue? Policy engines, languages, and standards are everywhere, making the decision for a good decision engine increasingly difficult. In this panel, I'll host four talented engineers, each from a different policy engine's core team, for a friendly showdown. We will assist the audience in making the most important decision - choosing a suitable and fitting decision engine for their specific use case. We will also delve into the nuances of running multiple engines together and learn how to scale them properly.
