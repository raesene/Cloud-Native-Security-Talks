## Abstract

Universal Identity (or Workload Identity) is a foundational concept that underpins every secure platform. When implemented well, it provides the platform and security teams the ability to reason about the entities running on their platform and the interactions between them.   SPIFFE has become the industry standard for establishing Identity that can be used to authenticate across all major cloud providers, on various workload platforms and even to an increasing number of third-party services. As SPIFFE adoption across various CNCF projects is growing, WebAssembly workloads present some unique challenges to simply lifting and shifting from what’s been done before.   This talk will cover the journey CNCF wasmCloud underwent in adopting SPIFFE as the foundation for providing Secure Production Identity for the WebAssembly Workloads running on the platform. We will share the lessons we learned from our journey, starting out with a concept to then bringing it all the way to production.
