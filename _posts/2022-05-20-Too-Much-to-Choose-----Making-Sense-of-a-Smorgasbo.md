title: "Too Much to Choose – Making Sense of a Smorgasbord of Security Standards - Anais Urlichs & Rory McCune, Aqua Security"
categories: ["KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022"]

## Abstract

As time goes by, there are an increasing number of security standards which Kubernetes cluster operators may be asked to comply with or get audited against. This talk will look at how Kubernetes security standards like the CIS benchmarks, DISA STIG, Pod Security Standards and the NSA hardening guide compare, where they compare and where they don’t. Additionally, we will also cover the recently released PCI guidance on container orchestration security. Once a standard has been chosen, the remaining pain lies in compliance. Luckily, the cloud native ecosystem provides several open-source tools to make it easier. We will look at using open source tooling to assess Kubernetes clusters against these standards. At the end of the presentation, the audience will gain a clear understanding of the benefits of each standard and the processes that can be adopted to comply with common requirements.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!
