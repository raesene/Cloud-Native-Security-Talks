## Abstract

Attestations are a useful tool for attaching supply chain metadata to artifacts and images, but how can we attach attestations to source code itself? In this talk, we'll go into some of the ways you can attach attestations to source code with Git. Learn how data can be stored verifiably alongside commits, how attestations can be modeled to describe SLSA source requirements, and how tools like Gitsign can make this easy to add to your CI/CD pipelines.
