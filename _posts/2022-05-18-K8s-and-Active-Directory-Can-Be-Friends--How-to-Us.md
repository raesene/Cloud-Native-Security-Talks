## Abstract

So, you’ve decided to migrate your applications to Kubernetes, but you still want to leverage your legacy Active Directory services to authenticate access to those applications. With Dex, this isn’t just possible, it’s easy! Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID connect to authenticate apps by configuring connectors to defer authentication to an external entity, such as an AD server using the LDAP protocol. Onkar has worked with multiple organizations to help them deploy Dex and configure the LDAP connector to meet such authentication requirements. During this hands-on tutorial, attendees will set up an open source AD server and add users and groups, then configure the Dex LDAP connector. Onkar will guide them through the process step-by-step, then wrap up with a demonstration of how to use Dex to authenticate access to a sample application. You’ll leave with practical experience and confidence to deploy the same configuration in a production environment.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!
