title: "Keyless Code Signing Without Fulcio - Nathan Smith, Chainguard"
categories: ["CloudNativeSecurityCon North America 2023"]

## Abstract

Sigstore's certificate authority Fulcio has popularized the idea of "keyless" signing. The keyless method makes signing hassle free by removing the need to manage private keys. Do you need to run Fulcio yourself if you want the same convenient signing flow, but you want your own trust root? No! In this talk, we'll walk through the what keyless signing really means and how to configure existing PKI solutions like Vault and stepca to use it.
