## Abstract

In the world of distributed computing, everything goes over the network, but not everything should be public. Unfortunately, Kubernetes networking is open by default and it is up to you to adopt network policies to secure it. Using our knowledge of implementing network policies in complex regulated environments, we will introduce the fundamentals of Cilium Network Policies and the basics of application-aware and Identity-based Security. With these building blocks in place, we will compare a default-allow with a default-deny policy and how a risk-based approach helps you focus on securing the most sensitive workloads first. We will then discuss various exposure types and strategies for securing your workloads. Applying this theoretical knowledge to the real world, we will explore how observability tools Cilium, Hubble, and Grafana provide you with Network Policy superpowers, like showing how ingress and egress connections are visualized, enabling you to configure the Network Policies using the Network Policy editor. Finally, we will discuss how Network Policy Guardrails allow for keeping control while granting teams self-service management of Network Policies. The audience will learn how to secure their network effectively and efficiently, even for highly sensitive workloads.
