## Abstract

Supply Chain requirements got you down? Getting an endless array of false positives from you ‘SBOM scanners’ ? Spending more of your time proving you don’t have a ‘false positive’ from your scanners than fixing real vulnerabilities in your code? There has to be a better way. There is. Come hear from Aeva and Ed about a new way to capture the full artifact dependency graph of your software, not as a ‘scan’ after the fact, but as an output of your build tools themselves. Find out when this feature is coming to a build tool near you.
