## Abstract

If you use JSON web tokens (JWTs) for authentication, handling them securely is your first and last line of defense. However properly using JWTs can be confusing. Even if you follow the specification you may still be vulnerable to some attacks. In this talk Bruce will give a friendly introduction to JWTs and how to work with them in your application. We will cover what is in a JWT, and how to make sure you can trust it. Once we understand the basics Bruce will demonstrate some common pitfalls in signature algorithm confusion and secret brute forcing. Finally, Bruce will cover JWT verification and security that will ensure you can trust your JWTs.
