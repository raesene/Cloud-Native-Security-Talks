## Abstract

Hello there dear developer building your app on open source dependencies. Oh wait, did you think open source code lives forever? Think again! Did you hear about the maintainer discontinuing a library despite having tens of millions of downloads? What about a maintainer who intentionally introduced code to break the functionality of his package which receives millions of downloads? So, did you ever wonder why dependencies die? Join me on a journey full of humor and horror across real-world incidents to learn how even the mightiest of open source projects got defeated. What can we learn from past incidents on the continuous struggles of open source software sustainability, maintainer burnout, and how it impacts us.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!
