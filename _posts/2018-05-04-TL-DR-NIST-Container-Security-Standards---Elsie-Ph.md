## Abstract

In September 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued a 63 page paper detailing their recommendations for container security. While it’s chock-full of recommendations all cloud native users should implement, it’s not a text most people will read. In this talk, Elsie Phillips from CoreOS will cover key takeaways from the report like the importance of using container-specific host OSs and using tooling specific to containers to monitor for vulnerabilities, as well as some suggestions for how to implement them within an organization.
