## Abstract

Most Cloud computing environments are based on self-service thus authorization configurations are frequent and dynamic. Furthermore, in Microservices architecture, each service communicates via Web APIs thus it is important to have precise and frequently configurable access controls with low cost. Athenz is an open source platform for X.509 certificate based service authentication and fine-grained access control in dynamic infrastructures that provides options to run multi environments with a single access control model. We also plan to provide integration with SPIFFE and Istio. In this session, the speaker is going to explain the benefits of using Athenz and demonstrate how to use Athenz in a Cloud computing environment by showing use case of the integration with Istio.
