## Abstract

DevOps was all about getting application developers and operations engineers to work together more effectively.  In large part, automated testing and infrastructure as code enabled repeatable deployments we could be confident would work in production.  Unfortunately, bottlenecks frequently arose in the software delivery process because the security team was never pulled into the fold.  Enter DevSecOps.  In this talk, we’ll cover how to integrate security into every step of the software development lifecycle to build a trusted software supply chain to production and how the Jenkins Templating Engine can accelerate the adoption of these practices at scale in your organization.
