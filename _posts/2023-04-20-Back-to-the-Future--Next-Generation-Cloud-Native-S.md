## Abstract

Cloud native security moves quickly: what will be the compounded effects of today’s emerging technologies on future architectural patterns? In this talk we’ll explore what security might look like in the cloud ecosystem of the future - from hardware, cryptography, architecture and software development patterns, to build an almost certainly fuzzy picture of what the coming years might bring. Bringing defence through an offensive lens, we model the ecosystem and look at how the industry can stride forward into the unknown. Peering into the void of uncertainty, we will: Appraise the state of tomorrow’s emergent cloud native security landscape Model an idealised security pipeline using next-generation technologies Highlight the challenges we need to overcome as an industry Call for community contributions to cut through the noise and define the future
