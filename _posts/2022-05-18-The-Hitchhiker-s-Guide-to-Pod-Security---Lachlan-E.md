## Abstract

With the release of Kubernetes v1.23, Pod Security admission has now entered beta. Pod Security is a built-in admission controller that evaluates Pod specifications against a predefined set of Pod Security Standards and determines whether to admit or deny the pod from running. Pod Security is the successor to PodSecurityPolicy which was deprecated in the v1.21 release, and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25. In this presentation I cover the key concepts of Pod Security along with how to use it walking through practical examples. Through education of this new security focused API I hope that cluster administrators and developers alike will use this new mechanism to enforce secure defaults for their workloads.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!
