## Abstract

Reverse proxies, services meshes and API Gateways are booming as the cloud native motion soars and eats the world. Meanwhile, the implications of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the variety of actors pursuing such capabilities threaten the underlying security and integrity of widely used software and network stacks. What happens to cloud native stacks, organizations which operate cloud stacks and to the operators when faced with an adversary who possesses a quantum computer? The issue necessitated the development of novel protocols and schema to protect the free flow of information across the internet. While public cloud providers are leading the industry charge in that aspect, the most popular reverse proxies, service meshes, and other commonly used software seems to not address those issues. In this panel we would like to share with you our work which includes the inception of quantum resistant cloud stack. We are porting Envoy and Istio to run quantum resistant cryptography algorithms across the stack thus incepting quantum resistant cloud native stack. We hope to see continued expansion of the effort is needed to cover multiple projects, undoubtedly with the help of the open-source community.
