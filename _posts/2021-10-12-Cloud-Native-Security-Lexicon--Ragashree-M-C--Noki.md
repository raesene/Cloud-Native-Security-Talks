## Abstract

Identity, credentials, and secrets, oh my! Making sense of all these security terms in a cloud native world can be confusing, especially with a vast array of tooling as expansive as the cloud native landscape. You may have found yourself talking past colleagues as certain security terms are overused, catch-all umbrellas, or even incorrectly presented. How do you know what secrets actually mean?
