## Abstract

The supply chain security working group has been working to provide guidance and resources for projects looking to improve their supply chain security. In this talk, we will discuss the outputs of this working group, including the Software Supply Chain Security Whitepaper, catalog of supply chain compromises, and our reference architecture for a secure supply chain. We will also discuss our recent survey about supply chain security, and have interactive discussions about next steps for this working group. Bring your questions and ideas about supply chain security!
