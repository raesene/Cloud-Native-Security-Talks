## Abstract

Container platforms and orchestration systems are becoming easier to setup and install, but setting up a production container system or even a PoC can be challenging.  In this talk, Michael Friis will introduce you to inner workings of Docker for AWS and Docker for Azure, two systems build by Docker for deploying and maintaining swarms on cloud infrastructure.  Come to this talk to learn what it takes to install and maintain easy-to-use container platforms on public clouds and to better under tradeoffs when choosing loadbalancers, logging and storage solutions. You'll leave this talk with ideas for how to better set up your cloud container solution and with a better understanding of how Docker for AWS and Azure are configured and used.
