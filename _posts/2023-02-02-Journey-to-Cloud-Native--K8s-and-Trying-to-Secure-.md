## Abstract

There are so many resources online about containers, Kubernetes, and Cloud security available to anyone who wants to know/learn about these technologies; this can be a good thing but can also be very confusing and chaotic, especially for people who are new to Cloud-Native and Open-source technologies/software. The first results returned by Google aren't usually the best for someone starting down their path in Cloud-Native Technology. It is even more challenging if you come from a very under-represented background in technology, where it is difficult to ask random people questions without feeling like a burden. This talk aims to guide newbies in their journey into Cloud-Native technologies such as Linux, containers, K8s, Iac, and securing clusters.
