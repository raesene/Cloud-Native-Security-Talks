## Abstract

As enterprises embrace AI, managing access for both human users and AI agents has become essential. Traditional access control methods can no longer meet the demands of AI-driven identities such as chatbots, AI agents, decision engines, and autonomous tools.   This talk explores how Policy as Code redefines fine-grained access control, enabling scalability for both humans and AI. Learn how to design flexible, auditable policies that support real-time decision-making and address AI-specific challenges. Tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) and OpenFGA will be featured, along with strategies for integrating AI-driven access models into zero-trust environments.   Through real-world case studies, discover how enterprises secure billions of interactions while fostering seamless collaboration between humans and machines.   Join me to gain practical insights into implementing scalable access control for todayâ€™s AI-powered ecosystems !
