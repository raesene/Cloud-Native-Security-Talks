## Abstract

Known vulnerabilities are a fact of life, especially with open source software. Cyber Security Intelligence tracked over 18,000 CVEs and at least 66 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in 2021. According to the Sonatype 2020 DevSecOps Community Survey, 24% of organizations surveyed revealed a breach within one of their web applications in the prior 12 months. The average cost of a data breach was $4.24 million, according to the IBM 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report. The only way to keep up with the fast pace and demands of cybersecurity today is to scale up the security expertise of your technical workforce. This talk explains why setting up a Security Champions program is such an important part of an overall cybersecurity strategy. Then it goes into detail on how to get your own Security Champions program running, the realistic costs of such a program, and what benefits you can expect from it.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!
