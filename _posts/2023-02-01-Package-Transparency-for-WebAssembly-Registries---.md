## Abstract

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a significant advancement in the portability and security of code, but for Wasm to be useful we need a way to publish and distribute it. This presents a unique opportunity to correspondingly advance the state of the art in supply chain security. That's why the Bytecode Alliance, a Wasm-focused non-profit, is working on developing a new registry protocol for Wasm packages, with security at the center, called warg. Warg is designed to offer "Package Transparency" by building on verifiable data structures from the field of Certificate Transparency. This means that the entire state of a registry can be validated by monitors, replicated by mirrors, and operator compromise can easily be detected. Come attend the talk to learn more about it from two Registry SIG members and implementors!
