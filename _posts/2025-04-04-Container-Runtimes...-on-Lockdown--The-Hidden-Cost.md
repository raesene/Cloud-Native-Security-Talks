## Abstract

Container runtimes form the bedrock of Kubernetes, but running diverse workloads side-by-side introduces complex security challenges that many teams overlook. This talk peels back the layers of container isolation, starting with the fundamentals of how containers operate as Linux processes and evolving through today's runtime landscape.We'll dive deep into the hidden costs and security implications of different container runtime choices in multi-tenant environments. Through real-world examples and performance benchmarks, we'll explore the delicate balance between isolation and efficiency. You'll learn about emerging solutions in the container runtime space and practical approaches to securing workloads without sacrificing performance.Attendees will leave with critical security considerations for choosing container runtimes, strategies for workload isolation, and tools to evaluate isolation versus performance tradeoffs.
