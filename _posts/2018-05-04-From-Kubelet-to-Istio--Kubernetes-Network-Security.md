title: "From Kubelet to Istio: Kubernetes Network Security Demystified - Andrew Martin, ControlPlane (Intermediate Skill Level) (Slides Attached)"
categories: ["KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018"]

## Abstract

Kubernetes provides multiple layers of network security including the control plane, etcd, the CNI network, network policies, and - with Istio on top - the requests between applications themselves. In this talk we explore the underlying technologies on which these layers are built using approachable examples and demonstrations. Attendees can expect to gain an understanding of these implementations and the principles behind encryption, identity, and trust in Kubernetes.- What are TLS, X.509, and mutual authentication?- Why cloud native communication should be encrypted by default- Kubernetes component intercommunication- CNI and network policy for applications - Bootstrapping identity with SPIFFE- Mutual TLS, route rules, and destination policies in Istio
