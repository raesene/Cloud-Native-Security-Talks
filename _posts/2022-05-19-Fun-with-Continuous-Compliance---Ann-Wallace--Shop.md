## Abstract

Is it possible to make compliance fun and less stressful? The old way of doing things is to manually gather evidence once or twice a year and hope nothing bad is found during your audit. This is not fun. In this talk, weâ€™ll go over the concepts of continuous compliance and how to apply this to your current DevSecOps program. Zeal will talk about how the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) can be used to create automated control based assessments. Lastly, Ann will walk through how Shopify uses OSS like Falco and Voucher to achieve continuous compliance at scale. You will walk away from this session with information on how you can make compliance fun or at least less painful.Click here to view captioning/translation in the MeetingPlay platform!
