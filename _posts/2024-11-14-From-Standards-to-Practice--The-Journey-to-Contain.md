## Abstract

Yelp runs tens of thousands of Docker containers in Kubernetes. How do we track their vulnerabilities, baseline their security needs, and prioritize our most critical findings? Security standards change constantly, so we need a robust model of container maturity to guide our adoption of these standards in a way that addresses Yelp’s specific needs and risk tolerance. Finally, to maximize our model’s value, over 1,000 engineers must understand its practical guidance well enough to apply it to their daily work. This talk covers designing and incorporating a container maturity model into Yelp’s development lifecycle, along with our strategy for proactively improving our security posture. We believe our experiences will assist others in creating similar models that work for their organizations, help evaluate and assess risks to their own containers, and drive next steps towards future risk evaluation platforms.
