## Abstract

Innovation and speed require cloud tools to build, deploy, and run cloud-native workloads. But how do I protect those workloads and mitigate the risks of running those apps in the cloud? Â This demo showcases how you can easily isolate Kubernetes clusters to ensure outbound Internet traffic is routed through in-cluster virtual firewalls to protect your resources and intellectual property.
