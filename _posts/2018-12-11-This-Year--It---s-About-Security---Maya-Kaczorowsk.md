## Abstract

The message was resoundingly clear at KubeCon EU, “this year, it’s about security”. Kubernetes has made giant strides in 2018 to improve security for end users.We’ll start with an overview of what’s happened in 2018, including the first container security attacks. Then, we’ll cover focus on three hot topic areas to dive deeper and demo: (1) Isolation, using projects like gVisor, Kata containers, and Nabla; (2) Software supply chain security, and (3) Security by default and hardening. You’ll leave with an understanding of new security features in Kubernetes, and how you can contribute to making Kubernetes secure.
