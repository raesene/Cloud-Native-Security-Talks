## Abstract

What does a threat model look like? How do you go about doing one? At TAG Security, we‚Äôve developed a lightweight threat model to let projects easily go through the exercise of modeling their project. In this session, we will have a hands-on exercise and create a threat model for the CNCF project using the lightweight model we‚Äôve developed!
