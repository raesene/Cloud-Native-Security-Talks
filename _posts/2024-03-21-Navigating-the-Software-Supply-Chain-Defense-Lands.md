## Abstract

Software supply chain attacks are on the rise, but so are the number of defense mechanisms. The proliferation of CNCF projects like in-toto and TUF in conjunction with other frameworks and systems like Sigstore and SLSA can make it hard to understand how all of these different tools work and the security guarantees they each provide. TAG Securityâ€™s Software Supply Chain working group has compiled a mapping of software supply chain tools to requirements from the Software Supply Chain Best Practices Guide. In this talk, we use this mapping to pull together different tools that can be combined for end-to-end software supply chain security. We provide example scenarios of combining certain tools and describe how folks can use the guide for their own software supply chains to determine the right tools for them.
