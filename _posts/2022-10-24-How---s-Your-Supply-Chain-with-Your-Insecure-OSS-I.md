title: "Howâ€™s Your Supply Chain with Your Insecure OSS Ingestion? - James Holland, Citi"

## Abstract

OSS libraries can be used by anyone, but how does an enterprise secure what should, or more importantly, should not be used? The package/artifact managers are at best simple proxies, so security checking is mostly beyond them. Moreover, within enterprises, these tasks end up being manual. This talk will outline the additional checks that should/could be performed at ingestion and subsequently; continuous automated grooming of OSS artifacts. James will demonstrate the Continuous Secure Software Ingestion (CSSI) application, a policy driven system built on Tekton & Open Policy Agent (OPA), to perform continuous secure ingestion from any source, including Google AOS. He will also show the additional constraints that are placed on the downstream enterprise Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tooling to handle the data graph that this generates.
