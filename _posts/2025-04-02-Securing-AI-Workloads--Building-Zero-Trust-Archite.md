## Abstract

As businesses increasingly rely on LLM applications for their important functions, it becomes important to implement strong security measures to protect sensitive information and guarantee smooth operations. This session shows how to build a zero-trust security architecture for AI workloads using cloud native patterns. We'll explore how to implement AI Gateways that have strong authentication and authorization and include audit logging. Keep compliance and governance requirements while you secure model artifacts and implement runtime security and protect against prompt injection attacks.
