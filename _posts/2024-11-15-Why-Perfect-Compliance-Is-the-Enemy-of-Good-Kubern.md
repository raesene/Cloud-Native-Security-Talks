## Abstract

Technology organizations often struggle over who should manage the security of their Kubernetes environment. This task usually falls to platform or cloud engineering teams, but they often feel abandoned by their security counterparts, uncertain of which requirements will deliver real security value. While published benchmarks and security guides for Kubernetes are helpful, not all recommendations work for every use-case. They may require Kubernetes alpha or beta features which could cause issues with platform stability. Our desire to prioritize “perfect” security over having a functional platform that addresses relevant risks can leave us with nothing, frustrating everyone. Kubernetes is meant to increase application delivery velocity, but when overly strict compliance prevents a team from moving forward, they will subvert security requirements. Let’s stop obsessing over the red in our security and compliance dashboards and focus on what adds real value by reducing risk.
