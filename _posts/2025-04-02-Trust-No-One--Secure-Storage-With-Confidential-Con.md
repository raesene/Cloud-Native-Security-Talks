## Abstract

If you are processing and storing sensitive data in the cloud, can you really trust anyone (including the cloud)? The answer is no. Confidential Containers (CoCo) is a CNCF project that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to tackle this challenge. A critical aspect in this effort is providing secure and confidential storage solutions that can be seamlessly deployed across cloud providers.   This session explores the implementation of trusted storage in CoCo, highlighting key aspects such as Kubernetes storage drivers, device virtualization, and the role of attestation in secure key release and data encryption. We also demonstrate how we prevent attackers from injecting data into the TEE using the CNCF Rego policy language.   Overall, we aim to show how cloud providers and end users can securely store and protect sensitive data, enabling the adoption of confidential computing across numerous use cases.
