## Abstract

Whether you are operating a 5-node or a 500-node Kubernetes clusters, ensuring the integrity and security of the traffic among your workloads is something that should be taken seriously. As your team grows, it is important to automate the application and management of different mTLS policies.In this talk, Ivan and Rita will share with you how Linkerd and Gatekeeper work together to automate and enforce mTLS policy in production. They will show you how easy it is to encrypt all east-west traffic using Linkerdâ€™s zero config automatic mTLS feature. Then, you will see how Gatekeeper is used to define, enforce and audit every workload entering your cluster to ensure configuration is valid and conformant to policy.
