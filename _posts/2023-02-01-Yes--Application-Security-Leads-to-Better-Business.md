## Abstract

Cloud native technologies give organizations a much better toolset to gain the agility to meet business challenges. According to a CNCF survey, security is one of the top three challenges in migrating to cloud native architectures. Inadequate confidence in security leads to fewer innovative solutions. DevSecOps and Shift Left are security practices that ensure vulnerabilities are found much earlier in a development process, improving confidence to deploy cloud native applications. Larry Carvalho, Principal Consultant at RobustCloud, will moderate this session. Hillary Benson, from Gitlab, will highlight how cloud native technologies, paired with the right strategy and toolset, present an outsized opportunity to reduce unnecessary security risk drastically. Kirsten Newcomer, from Red Hat, will share how to holistically secure your platform and application and enable teams to build secure pipelines with security controls as close to the developer as they wish. David Zendzian, from VMware, will discuss how shifting left security outcomes can only partially translate into building new skills for the developer community. In this session, you will hear examples of companies using application security practices to reduce the risk of non-compliance and deliver innovative solutions.
