## Abstract

With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, concerns about data privacy and infrastructure security are increasing. This session will focus on confidential cloud functions, including serverless environments and GPU-accelerated workloads, to ensure the security of your code and data within the cloud infrastructure. We will explore technologies such as hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and confidential computing. In addition, we will cover hardware and software attestation to guarantee integrity from the silicon level upwards, complete stack attestation for end-to-end trust, and supply chain security to trace and verify all application components. Participants will learn practical steps to implement confidential serverless functions, utilizing GPUs for high-performance computing while ensuring data integrity and privacy. Join us to discover how to innovate securely, build your own secure cloud functions infrastructure, and enhance your cloud security posture.
