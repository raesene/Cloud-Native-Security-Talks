## Abstract

In a world where containers are centre stage it's important that they look and feel their best. In this talk we will go over the Kubernetes security checklist - identifying quick fixes that will yield huge gains. Together Cailyn and the audience will take a container from flimsy and squishy to rock solid in a Rocky worthy montage of a demo. Become the trainer your containers need, and ensure that your security routines are sustainable and maintainable! From slim images, to access control we will cover techniques and tools that will make your security dreams a reality. Attendees will leave this talk with a list of Cloud Native tools that will take their container security to the next level and help their containers get a PB on their next CIS BENCHmark!
