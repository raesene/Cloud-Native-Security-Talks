title: "Network Security at Scale: L3 Through L7 at Splunk - Mitch Connors, Aviatrix & Bernard Van De Walle, Splunk"

## Abstract

What does it take to securely connect dozens of clusters across multiple cloud providers at Splunk scale, while not disrupting the agility that is required to compete in the modern marketplace? How do you balance security at L3 and L4 with the flexibility and identity needs of L7? Join us to explore Splunk’s networking stack, starting at multi-cloud VPCs for L3, and Istio for L4 and L7. We’ll also discuss how some of the pain points in this architecture are driving the new Istio Ambient design.
