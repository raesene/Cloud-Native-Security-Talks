## Abstract

Supply chains are critical in many industries, but are only gaining attention as vitally important in the software industry in the past couple years. What can we learn from established supply chain best practices, and from the biggest failures in various industry supply chains? How can we apply that to our own work in securing our own critical infrastructure? In this talk we will discuss the evolution of supply chain processes in the physical world. Weâ€™ll explore what parts of physical supply chains apply to our work, how they have been implemented in those paradigms, what sorts of failures can and have occurred, and how we can utilize the lessons learned in our own software supply chain pipelines.
